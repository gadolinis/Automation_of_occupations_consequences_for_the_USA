# Automation_of_occupations_consequences_for_the_USA

## Project motivation

AI and Automation will indeed wreak havoc among the workforce rending a large part of the population useless and without economic value in the next decade or two. Not only automation will take your jobs, but it will make the rich even richer. If you are looking for job opportunities that are less likely to be affected by AI or automation, well youâ€™re in the right place.
In this project I am going to analyze:
Which occupations are the most sensitive and the most robust to automation (computerization)?
What are the jobs lost in the US, if automation takes out occupations with automation probability equal to 0.7 or higher?
Which US states are the most sensitive and the most robust to automation?
Compare the most common occupations for automation in the US.

Probability higher than 0.7 representing a "high risk category, meaning that associated occupations are potentially automatable over some unspecified number of years, perhaps a decade or two" according to the original research paper. We can look to this probability as to a time frame, where higher propabilty occupations are likely to be automated sooner.
The lost work positions and state population ratio. I take lost work position, when work automation probability ir equal to 0.7 or higher (threshhold >= 0.7).
I estimated, that these total job numbers are about 10%, due to jabs position not included. I got data with all jobs where data was not available or there were less than 10 employees were marked as zero.

Lets look, what are reliative loss numbers.

South Dakota and Nevada have most jobs losses. Lets look, what are biggest occupations they lost. Let's start with Nevada data

Now let's look to South Dakota

Massachusetts data

District of Columbia has lowest sensitivity for automation. Let's check the data.
